## There are 12 different types of cybersecurity. 

For example: 
### 1. Network Security
Protects internal networks from unauthorized access, intrusions, and attacks.
- Firewall: Filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules.
- Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS): Detects suspicious or malicious activity, and IPS actively blocks threats in real-time.

### 2. Application Security
Focuses on ensuring applications are free from vulnerabilities and secure throughout their lifecycle.
- Penetration Testing: Simulating attacks to identify and fix weaknesses in applications.
- Secure Coding: Writing code that mitigates vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows or SQL injections.

### 3. Data Security
Protects sensitive data at rest, in transit, and during processing.
- Encryption: Ensures that data is only readable by authorized parties, using algorithms like AES or RSA.
- Backups: Regularly storing data copies in secure locations to prevent loss due to breaches or hardware failure.

### 4. Cloud Security
Protects cloud-based systems, applications, and data.
- Infrastructure Security: Ensuring virtual machines, storage, and networks in the cloud are secure.
- Identity and Access Management (IAM): Managing permissions and access to cloud resources using tools like multi-factor authentication.

### 5. Endpoint Security
Focuses on securing devices such as laptops, desktops, mobile phones, and IoT devices.
- Tools: Antivirus, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), and Mobile Device Management (MDM).
