## ACLs = Access Control List

ACE = Access Control Element (éléments de la liste)

Les **ACL**, pour _**A**ccess **C**ontrol **L**ist_, sont des règles appliquées aux trafics transitant via les interfaces du routeur que ce soit en entrée (_in_) ou en sortie (_out_). Les ACL filtrent le trafic en demandant aux interfaces d’acheminer ou non les paquets qui y transitent. Pour ce faire, le routeur lit l'en-tête de chaque paquet afin de déterminer s'il doit être acheminé ou non en fonction des conditions définies dans la liste de contrôle d’accès ACLs.

DIifférents types d'ACLs

- **Standard** : Elles sont numérotées de 1 à 99 et de 1300 à 1999. Pour le filtrage, c'est  IPv4 source
- **Etendue** : Elles peuvent aussi être numérotées de 100 à 199 et de 2000 à 2699. Elles peuvent aussi être nommées. Pour le filtrage, c'est IPv4 Source et Destination, IPv6 Source et Destination, Ports, Protocoles, @MAC (Option)

Les ACLs standards se positionnent **toujours** proche de la destination.
ACLs standards sur interface en entrée ET en sortie

# EXERCICE 1:

## Part 1: Verify Local Connectivity and Test Access Control List
### Step 1: Ping devices on the local network to verify connectivity.
a.     From the command prompt of PC1, ping PC2.  **Oui ça ping** 
b.     From the command prompt of PC1, ping PC3. **Oui ça ping** 

Question: Why were the pings successful?   **Dans le routeur en faisant show run on a ça :** 
**access-list 11 deny 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255**
**access-list 11 permit any**

### Step 2: Ping devices on remote networks to test ACL functionality.
a.     From the command prompt of PC1, ping PC4.  **Destination host unreachable.**
b.     From the command prompt of PC1, ping the DNS Server. **Destination host unreachable.**

Question: Why did the pings fail? (Hint: Use simulation mode or view the router configurations to investigate.) Les pings ne fonctionnent pas car ils restent uniquement dans le réseau 192.168.10.0 et 192.168.11.0. Il n'y a pas les même configs dans le R1 et R2 donc ça ne communique pas 
router ospf 1
log-adjacency-changes
network 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 area 10
network 192.168.11.0 0.0.0.255 area 11
network 10.10.1.0 0.0.0.3 area 0

## Part 2: Remove the ACL and Repeat the Test
### Step 1: Use show commands to investigate the ACL configuration.

a.     show access-lists ?
b.     show run | include interface|access
Question : To which interface and in what direction is the ACL applied?

### Step 2: Remove access list 11 from the configuration.
You can remove ACLs from the configuration by issuing the no access list [number of the ACL] command. The no access-list command when used without arguments deletes all ACLs configured on the router. The no access-list [number of the ACL] command removes only a specific ACL. Removing an ACL from a router does not remove the ACL from the interface. The command that applies the ACL to the interface must be removed separately.

a.     Under the Serial0/0/0 interface, remove access-list 11, which was previously applied to the interface as an outgoing filter:

R1(config)# interface s0/0/0
R1(config-if)# no ip access-group 11 out

b.     In global configuration mode, remove the ACL by entering the following command:

R1(config)# no access-list 11

c.     Verify that PC1 can now ping the DNS Server and PC4. c'est bon c'est ok


# EXERCICE 2 :

## Part 1: Plan an ACL Implementation
### Step 1: Investigate the current network configuration.
Before applying any ACLs to a network, it is important to confirm that you have full connectivity. Verify that the network has full connectivity by choosing a PC and pinging other devices on the network. You should be able to successfully ping every device.

Step 2: Evaluate two network policies and plan ACL implementations.
a.     The following network policies are implemented on R2:
- The 192.168.11.0/24 network is not allowed access to the WebServer on the 192.168.20.0/24 network.
- All other access is permitted.

To restrict access from the 192.168.11.0/24 network to the WebServer at 192.168.20.254 without interfering with other traffic, an ACL must be created on R2. The access list must be placed on the outbound interface to the WebServer. A second rule must be created on R2 to permit all other traffic.

b.     The following network policies are implemented on R3:
- The 192.168.10.0/24 network is not allowed to communicate with the 192.168.30.0/24 network.
- All other access is permitted.

To restrict access from the 192.168.10.0/24 network to the 192.168.30/24 network without interfering with other traffic, an access list will need to be created on R3. The ACL must be placed on the outbound interface to PC3. A second rule must be created on R3 to permit all other traffic.

## Part 2: Configure, Apply, and Verify a Standard ACL
### Step 1: Configure and apply a numbered standard ACL on R2.
a.     Create an ACL using the number 1 on R2 with a statement that denies access to the 192.168.20.0/24 network from the 192.168.11.0/24 network.

R2(config)# access-list 1 deny 192.168.11.0 0.0.0.255

b.     By default, an access list denies all traffic that does not match any rules. To permit all other traffic, configure the following statement:

R2(config)# access-list 1 permit any

c.     Before applying an access list to an interface to filter traffic, it is a best practice to review the contents of the access list, in order to verify that it will filter traffic as expected.

R2# show access-lists
Standard IP access list 1
10 deny 192.168.11.0 0.0.0.255
20 permit any

d.     For the ACL to actually filter traffic, it must be applied to some router operation. Apply the ACL by placing it for outbound traffic on the GigabitEthernet 0/0 interface. Note: In an actual operational network, it is not a good practice to apply an untested access list to an active interface.

R2(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0
R2(config-if)# ip access-group 1 out

### Step 2: Configure and apply a numbered standard ACL on R3.
a.     Create an ACL using the number 1 on R3 with a statement that denies access to the 192.168.30.0/24 network from the PC1 (192.168.10.0/24) network.

R3(config)# access-list 1 deny 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255

b.     By default, an ACL denies all traffic that does not match any rules. To permit all other traffic, create a second rule for ACL 1.

R3(config)# access-list 1 permit any

c.     Verify that the access list is configured correctly.

R3# show access-lists
Standard IP access list 1
10 deny 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255
20 permit any

d.     Apply the ACL by placing it for outbound traffic on the GigabitEthernet 0/0 interface.

R3(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0
R3(config-if)# ip access-group 1 out

### Step 3: Verify ACL configuration and functionality.
a.     Enter the show run or show ip interface gigabitethernet 0/0 command to verify the ACL placements.

b.     With the two ACLs in place, network traffic is restricted according to the policies detailed in Part 1. Use the following tests to verify the ACL implementations:

·         A ping from 192.168.10.10 to 192.168.11.10 succeeds.
·         A ping from 192.168.10.10 to 192.168.20.254 succeeds.
·         A ping from 192.168.11.10 to 192.168.20.254 fails.
·         A ping from 192.168.10.10 to 192.168.30.10 fails.
·         A ping from 192.168.11.10 to 192.168.30.10 succeeds.
·         A ping from 192.168.30.10 to 192.168.20.254 succeeds.

c.     Issue the show access-lists command again on routers R2 and R3. You should see output that indicates the number of packets that have matched each line of the access list. Note: The number of matches shown for your routers may be different, due to the number of pings that are sent and received.

R2# show access-lists
Standard IP access list 1
10 deny 192.168.11.0 0.0.0.255 (4 match(es))
20 permit any (8 match(es)
 
R3# show access-lists
Standard IP access list 1
10 deny 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 (4 match(es))
20 permit any (8 match(es))

# EXERCICE 3

## Part 1: Configure and Apply a Named Standard ACL
### Step 1: Verify connectivity before the ACL is configured and applied.
All three workstations should be able to ping both the Web Server and File Server.

### Step 2: Configure a named standard ACL.
Open configuration window

a.     Configure the following named ACL on R1.

R1(config)# ip access-list standard File_Server_Restrictions
R1(config-std-nacl)# permit host 192.168.20.4
R1(config-std-nacl)# permit host 192.168.100.100
R1(config-std-nacl)# deny any

Note: For scoring purposes, the ACL name is case-sensitive, and the statements must be in the same order as shown.

b.     Use the show access-lists command to verify the contents of the access list before applying it to an interface. Make sure you have not mistyped any IP addresses and that the statements are in the correct order.

R1# show access-lists
Standard IP access list File_Server_Restrictions
10 permit host 192.168.20.4
20 permit host 192.168.100.100
30 deny any

### Step 3: Apply the named ACL.
a.     Apply the ACL outbound on the Fast Ethernet 0/1 interface.

Note: In an actual operational network, applying an access list to an active interface is not a good practice and should be avoided if possible.

R1(config-if)# ip access-group File_Server_Restrictions out

b.     Save the configuration.

## Part 2: Verify the ACL Implementation
### Step 1: Verify the ACL configuration and application to the interface.

Use the show access-lists command to verify the ACL configuration. Use the show run or show ip interface fastethernet 0/1 command to verify that the ACL is applied correctly to the interface.

### Step 2: Verify that the ACL is working properly.

All three workstations should be able to ping the Web Server, but only PC1 and the Web Server should be able to ping the File Server. Repeat the show access-lists command to see the number of packets that matched each statement.

# EXERCICE 4

## Part 1: Verify Connectivity
In Part 1, you verify connectivity between devices.

Note: It is very important to test whether connectivity is working before you configure and apply access lists. You want to be sure that your network is properly functioning before you start to filter traffic.

Questions:
From PC-A, ping PC-C and PC-D. Were your pings successful? OUI ça ping 
From R1, ping PC-C and PC-D. Were your pings successful? OUI ça ping 
From PC-C, ping PC-A and PC-B. Were your pings successful? OUI ça ping 
From R3, ping PC-A and PC-B. Were your pings successful? OUI ça ping 
Can all of the PCs ping the server at 209.165.200.254? OUI ça ping 

### Part 2: Configure and Verify Standard Numbered and Named ACLs
### Step 1: Configure a numbered standard ACL.
Standard ACLs filter traffic based on the source IP address only. A typical best practice for standard ACLs is to configure and apply the ACL as close to the destination as possible. For the first access list in this activity, create a standard numbered ACL that allows traffic from all hosts on the 192.168.10.0/24 network and all hosts on the 192.168.20.0/24 network to access all hosts on the 192.168.30.0/24 network. The security policy also states that an explicit deny any access control entry (ACE), also referred to as an ACL statement, should be present at the end of all ACLs.

Questions: What wildcard mask would you use to allow all hosts on the 192.168.10.0/24 network to access the 192.168.30.0/24 network?  **0.0.0.255**

Following Cisco’s recommended best practices, on which router would you place this ACL?
On which interface would you place this ACL? In what direction would you apply it?

a.     Configure the ACL on R3. Use 1 for the access list number.

R3(config)# access-list 1 remark Allow R1 LANs Access
R3(config)# access-list 1 permit 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255
R3(config)# access-list 1 permit 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255
R3(config)# access-list 1 deny any

b.     Apply the ACL to the appropriate interface in the proper direction.

R3(config)# interface g0/0/0
R3(config-if)# ip access-group 1 out

c.     Verify a numbered ACL.

The use of various show commands can help you to verify both the syntax and placement of your ACLs in your router.

Questions: To see access list 1 in its entirety with all ACEs, which command would you use? **show access-lists 1**
What command would you use to see where the access list was applied and in what direction? **show ip interface g0/0/0**

1)    On R3, issue the show access-lists 1 command.

R3# show access-list 1
Standard IP access list 1
permit 192.168.10.0, wildcard bits 0.0.0.255
permit 192.168.20.0, wildcard bits 0.0.0.255
deny any

1)    On R3, issue the show ip interface g0/0/0 command.

R3# show ip interface g0/0/0
GigabitEthernet0/0/0 is up, line protocol is up (connected)
Internet address is 192.168.30.1/24
Broadcast address is 255.255.255.255
Address determined by setup command
MTU is 1500 bytes
Helper address is not set
Directed broadcast forwarding is disabled
Outgoing access list is 1
Inbound access list is not set

1)    Test the ACL to see if it allows traffic from the 192.168.10.0/24 network to access the 192.168.30.0/24 network. **OUI ça ping**

From the PC-A command prompt, ping the PC-C IP address. Were the pings successful? 

1)    Test the ACL to see if it allows traffic from the 192.168.20.0/24 network access to the 192.168.30.0/24 network. **OUI ça ping**

From the PC-B command prompt, ping the PC-C IP address. Were the pings successful?

1)    Should pings from PC-D to PC-C be successful? Ping from PC-D to PC-C to verify your answer. NON ça ping pas

d.     From the R1 prompt, ping PC-C’s IP address again.

R1# ping 192.168.30.3

Question: Was the ping successful? Explain. Le ping ne marche pas parce que le R1 n'a pas la même config que R3

e.     Issue the show access-lists 1 command again. Note that the command output displays information for the number of times each ACE was matched by traffic that reached interface Gigabit Ethernet 0/0/0.

R3# show access-lists 1
Standard IP access list 1
permit 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 (4 match(es))
permit 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255 (4 match(es))
deny any (4 match(es))

Step 2: Configure a named standard ACL.
Create a named standard ACL that conforms to the following policy: allow traffic from all hosts on the 192.168.40.0/24 network access to all hosts on the 192.168.10.0/24 network. Also, only allow host PC-C access to the 192.168.10.0/24 network. The name of this access list should be called BRANCH-OFFICE-POLICY.

Questions: Following Cisco’s recommended best practices, on which router would you place this ACL? On which interface would you place this ACL? In what direction would you apply it?

a.     Create the standard named ACL BRANCH-OFFICE-POLICY on R1.

R1(config)# ip access-list standard BRANCH-OFFICE-POLICY
R1(config-std-nacl)# permit host 192.168.30.3
R1(config-std-nacl)# permit 192.168.40.0 0.0.0.255
R1(config-std-nacl)# end
R1#
*Feb 15 15:56:55.707: %SYS-5-CONFIG_I: Configured from console by console*

Question: Look at the first ACE in the access list. What is another way to write this?

b.     Apply the ACL to the appropriate interface in the proper direction.

R1# config t
R1(config)# interface g0/0/0
R1(config-if)# ip access-group BRANCH-OFFICE-POLICY out

c.     Verify a named ACL.

1)    On R1, issue the show access-lists command.

R1# show access-lists
Standard IP access list BRANCH-OFFICE-POLICY
10 permit host 192.168.30.3
20 permit 192.168.40.0 0.0.0.255

Question: Is there any difference between this ACL on R1 and the ACL on R3? If so, what is it?

2)    On R1, issue the show ip interface g0/0/0 command to verify that the ACL is configured on the interface.

R1# show ip interface g0/0/0
GigabitEthernet0/0/0 is up, line protocol is up (connected)
Internet address is 192.168.10.1/24
Broadcast address is 255.255.255.255
Address determined by setup command
MTU is 1500 bytes
Helper address is not set
Directed broadcast forwarding is disabled
Outgoing access list is BRANCH-OFFICE-POLICY
Inbound access list is not set

Test the ACL. From the command prompt on PC-C, ping the IP address of PC-A. Were the pings successful? Oui ça ping

3)    Test the ACL to ensure that only the PC-C host is allowed access to the 192.168.10.0/24 network. You must do an extended ping and use the G0/0/0 address on R3 as your source. Ping PC-A’s IP address.

R3# ping

Question: Were the pings successful? OUI ça ping

4)    Test the ACL to see if it allows traffic from the 192.168.40.0/24 network access to the 192.168.10.0/24 network. From the PC-D command prompt, ping the PC-A IP address.

Question: Were the pings successful? OUI


### Part 3: Modify a Standard ACL
It is common in business for security policies to change. For this reason, ACLs may need to be modified. In Part 3, you will change one of the ACLs you configured previously to match a new management policy that is being put in place.

Attempt to ping the server at 209.165.200.254 from PC-A. Notice that the ping is not successful. The ACL on R1 is blocking internet traffic from returning to PC-A. This is because the source address in the packets that are returned is not in the range of permitted addresses.

Management has decided that traffic that is returning from the 209.165.200.224/27 network should be allowed full access to the 192.168.10.0/24 network. Management also wants ACLs on all routers to follow consistent rules. A deny any ACE should be placed at the end of all ACLs. You must modify the BRANCH-OFFICE-POLICY ACL.

You will add two additional lines to this ACL. There are two ways you could do this:

OPTION 1: Issue a no ip access-list standard BRANCH-OFFICE-POLICY command in global configuration mode. This would remove the ACL from the router. Depending upon the router IOS, one of the following scenarios would occur: all filtering of packets would be cancelled, and all packets would be allowed through the router; or, because you did not remove the ip access-group command from the G0/1 interface, filtering is still in place. Regardless, when the ACL is gone, you could retype the whole ACL, or cut and paste it in from a text editor.

OPTION 2: You can modify ACLs in place by adding or deleting specific lines within the ACL itself. This can come in handy, especially with ACLs that are long. The retyping of the whole ACL or cutting and pasting can easily lead to errors. Modifying specific lines within the ACL is easily accomplished.

For this activity, use Option 2.

### Step 1: Modify a named standard ACL.
a. From R1, issue the show access-lists command.

R1# show access-lists
Standard IP access list BRANCH-OFFICE-POLICY
10 permit 192.168.30.3 (8 matches)
20 permit 192.168.40.0 0.0.0.255 (5 matches)

b. Add two additional lines at the end of the ACL. From global config mode, modify the ACL, BRANCH-OFFICE-POLICY.

R1#(config)# ip access-list standard BRANCH-OFFICE-POLICY
R1(config-std-nacl)# 30 permit 209.165.200.224 0.0.0.31
R1(config-std-nacl)# 40 deny any
R1(config-std-nacl)# end

c. Verify the ACL.

1)    On R1, issue the show access-lists command.
   
R1# show access-lists
Standard IP access list BRANCH-OFFICE-POLICY
10 permit 192.168.30.3 (8 matches)
20 permit 192.168.40.0, wildcard bits 0.0.0.255 (5 matches)
30 permit 209.165.200.224, wildcard bits 0.0.0.31
40 deny any

Question: Do you have to apply the BRANCH-OFFICE-POLICY to the G0/1 interface on R1?

1)    Test the ACL to see if it allows traffic from the 209.165.200.224/27 network access to return to the 192.168.10.0/24 network. From PC-A, ping the server at 209.165.200.254.

Question: Were the pings successful? OUI ça ping

Reflection Questions
1. As you can see, standard ACLs are very powerful and work quite well. Why would you ever have the need for using extended ACLs?

2.  More typing is typically required when using a named ACL as opposed to a numbered ACL. Why would you choose named ACLs over numbered?
